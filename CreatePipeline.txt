Steps to Create a Pipeline in AWS
Open AWS Console
Go to AWS CodePipeline service.
Create Pipeline
Click Create pipeline.
Pipeline Settings
Give your pipeline a name (e.g., MySamplePipeline).
Optionally, create or select a service role (AWS can create one for you).
Source Stage (Where your code lives)
Choose the source provider:
GitHub (v2) → if your repo is on GitHub.
CodeCommit → if using AWS CodeCommit.
Amazon S3 → if your code is in an S3 bucket.
Connect to the repository and branch you want to trigger builds from.
Build Stage (Compile & test your code)
Add a build stage.
Choose AWS CodeBuild as the provider.
Select an existing CodeBuild project or create a new one (you’ll need a buildspec.yml file).
Deploy Stage (Optional)
If you want deployment, add a deploy stage:
Amazon S3 → static website hosting.
Amazon ECS → container apps.
Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, or CodeDeploy for more complex apps.
If you don’t want deployment yet, you can skip this.
Review & Create
Review pipeline settings.
Click Create pipeline.
The pipeline will immediately start its first run.
